                    <p>There are so many travel websites and mobile apps that you can often feel overwhelmed and rather use old<br>
                    school methods.</p>
                    <p>I personally tried and tested more than hundred of them and created a collection of the best travel websites<br>
                    and mobile apps. I promise that this post will make your nomadic life much easier, enjoyable, and will save<br>
                    you money in every stage of your journey.</p>
                    <p>We live in a fast-paced environment where new products emerge on a daily basis. Therefore, this post is meant<br>
                    to be continuously updated – don’t forget to bookmark it so you can get back later on.</p>
                    <h2>Airfare Search</h2>
                    <p>This is where it always begins. When you decide to travel abroad, your first clicks definitely lead<br>
                    to some airfare search engine to check flight availability and fares.</p>
                    <p>Every service below has its pros and cons, and I would encourage you to give a try to each of them. Basically,<br>
                    you never know which one included some hot fares into its inventory.</p>
                    <p>Since the price of the flight ticket always plays the key role when deciding where to buy, I compared following<br>
                    search engines by using the same flight:</p>
                    <p class="lead">London (all airports) – New York (all airports)<br>

                    <h3 class="inline-title"><a href="http://www.skyscanner.com" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a></h3>
                    <h4>Price: Free</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Cheapest Offer:</strong> $397 – Norwegian / London Gatwick (LGW) – New York (JFK) / Direct Flight</h5>
                    <p>Skyscanner is one of major flight search engines. It searches flight fares across travel agents and airlines,<br>
                    including low-cost carriers. Skyscanner’s user interface is responsive and multilingual.</p>
                    <p>You always book directly with the airline or travel agent, so you don’t pay any extra fee to Skyscanner. Once<br>
                    you select the flight, Skyscanner redirects you to appropriate fare provider. If the fare is still available,<br>
                    you can continue with the booking. In the case of my reference flight, the fare eventually increased to $444.</p>
                    <p>You can set price alerts by entering your email address, so Skyscanner can notify you about drops or rises of<br>
                    the fare.<br>

                    <h5><strong>Pros:</strong> Multilingual responsive website. Great mobile app. Fare alerts. Low-cost airlines are included.</h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cons:</strong> Flight fares can change significantly. Redirecting to the seller’s site makes user experience quite confusing.</h5>

                    <h3 class="inline-title"><a href="http://snip.ly/jnpc" target="_blank">Momondo</a></h3>
                    <h4>Price: Free</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Lasse from Momondo recommends:</strong><a href="http://www.splittrapp.com/">Splittr</a><a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a><a href="http://www.whatsapp.com" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a></h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cheapest Offer:</strong> $369 / Norwegian / London Gatwick (LGW) – Stockholm (ARN) – New York (JFK) / 1 Stopover</h5>
                    <p>Momondo is another web &amp; mobile flight search engine. It searches flight fares across travel agents and<br>
                    airlines, including low-cost carriers. Its user interface is responsive and multilingual.</p>
                    <p>Once you select the flight, Momondo redirects you to appropriate fare provider. If the fare is still<br>
                    available, you can continue with the booking. Our flight fare eventually dropped to $373 which was a nice<br>
                    surprise.</p>
                    <p>You can freely use Momondo’s basic flight filters but in fact it’s not necessary. Momondo shows you the<br>
                    cheapest, quickest and the best flight offer on the top of the search result page.</p>
                    <p>You can also set a fare alert. You will then receive Momondo’s notification about possible price drops<br>
                    right into your mailbox.</p>
                    <p>There is also a basic graph on the top of the page showing you estimated prices for different dates. I don’t<br>
                    know Momondo’s algorithm, but I think it’s worth a try if your travel dates are flexible.<br>

                    <h5><strong>Pros:</strong> Nice user interface. Fare alerts. Low-cost airlines are included. Multilingual and mobile friendly website.</h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cons:</strong> Redirecting to the seller’s site makes user experience quite confusing. Shows slightly different fares in the mobile app (cheaper in our case).</h5>

                    <h3 class="inline-title"><a href="http://www.kayak.com" target="_blank">Kayak</a></h3>
                    <h4>Price: Free</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Cheapest Offer:</strong> $398 / Norwegian / London Gatwick (LGW) – New York (JFK) / Direct Flight</h5>
                    <p>Kayak is another flight fare search engine you should visit. It has also a clean user interface,<br>
                    mobile-friendly website and powerful mobile app.</p>
                    <p>As above-mentioned search engines, Kayak searches flight fares across travel agents and airlines.<br>
                    It also includes low-cost carriers and once you select the flight, it redirects you to the seller’s<br>
                    website.</p>
                    <p>If you consider it important, Kayak shows you an operating airline right under the flight details.</p>
                    <p>When Kayak redirected me to the Norwegian’s website, the fare of my reference flight eventually raised to $453.<br>
                    It made a difference of more than $50 which is more than I would accept.</p>
                    <p>I believe that Kayak is primarily focused on its mobile app. In comparison with the website, the app<br>
                    provides you also with flight tracker, price alerts, and information about airlines and airports. This is a<br>
                    main reason why I consider Kayak as my favourite travel mobile application.<br>

                    <h5><strong>Pros:</strong> Great user interface both on the website and mobile app. Mobile-friendly website. Low-cost airlines are included. Flight details with actual operating airline. Multipurpose mobile app.</h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cons:</strong> Fare alert only on mobile app. Redirecting to the seller’s site makes user experience quite confusing. A flight fare can change significantly.</h5>

                    <div id="hipmunk" class="item">
                    <h3 class="inline-title"><a href="http://snip.ly/8sSf" target="_blank">Hipmunk</a></h3>
                    <h4>Price: Free</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Fiona from Hipmunk recommends:</strong><a href="#citymapper">Citymapper</a><a href="#wifi-finder">WiFi Finder</a><a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a></h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cheapest Offer:</strong> $437 / Norwegian / London Gatwick (LGW) – New York (JFK) / Direct Flight</h5>
                    <p>I wouldn’t leave home without Hipmunk. It’s not because it is the best search engine with the greatest<br>
                    deals possible. It’s because I really like their clean user interface and flying hamster logo.</p>
                    <p>You can sort search results by price, duration of a flight, takeoff and landing times, or by Hipmunk’s<br>
                    Agony index. Agony index is a combination of price, number of stops, and duration of the flight.</p>
                    <p>Hipmunk found my reference flight at a price of $437. The same as other search engines above, Hipmunk redirects<br>
                    you to appropriate fare provider. In this case, the final fare was the same as displayed which is a plus.</p>
                    <p>Fare alerts work reliably. You can also integrate your own calendars into Hipmunk’s search results, so you never<br>
                    book a wrong date. <a href="http://ctt.ec/IaCXR" target="_blank">Click to tweet the love</a></p>
                    <h5><strong>Pros:</strong> Great user interface both on the website and mobile app. Low-cost airlines are included. Promised fare was the final one. Sync with personal calendars.</h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cons:</strong> Redirecting to the seller’s site makes user experience quite confusing.</h5>

                    <h3 class="inline-title"><a href="http://snip.ly/95Gc" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a></h3>
                    <h4>Price: Free</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Cheapest Offer:</strong> $398 / Norwegian / London Gatwick (LGW) – New York (JFK) / Direct Flight</h5>
                    <p>Although I initially found TripAdvisor useful only for hotel search and as a destination guide, its<br>
                    flight search engine works well too.</p>
                    <p>It searches flight fares across travel agents and airlines, including low-cost carriers. Once you select<br>
                    the flight, TripAdvisor redirects you to appropriate fare provider.</p>
                    <p>TripAdvisor gave me the same fare as Kayak and Skyscanner. What is more important is the fact that it<br>
                    also allowed me to book it for the same price. TripAdvisor’s mobile app showed me different fares than<br>
                    its website for the same travel agents.</p>
                    <h5><strong>Pros:</strong> Multipurpose travel website and mobile app. Promised fare was the final one. Mobile-friendly website.</h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn’t include major low-cost airlines (e.g. RyanAir). Fare alert missing. Different fares on the website and mobile app. Redirecting to the seller’s site makes user experience quite confusing.</h5>

                    <div id="skypicker" class="item">
                    <h3 class="inline-title"><a href="http://snip.ly/12Yd" target="_blank">Skypicker</a></h3>
                    <h4>Price: Free</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Jozef from Skypicker recommends:</strong><a href="http://www.uber.com">Uber</a><a href="#hotel-tonight">HotelTonight</a><a href="http://www.azair.eu" target="_blank">AZair</a></h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cheapest Offer:</strong> $347 / Norwegian / London Gatwick (LGW) – Stockholm (ARN) – New York (JFK) / 1 Stopover</h5>
                    <h5><strong>Best Offer:</strong> $427 / Norwegian / London Gatwick (LGW) – New York (JFK) / Direct Flight</h5>
                    <p>Skypicker is my favourite flight fare search engine. They’ve developed an extensive in-house<br>
                    inventory of thousands of low-cost flights, so there is no need to redirect you to the seller’s website.</p>
                    <p>User experience is outstanding. The main part of the website is covered by an interactive map showing<br>
                    you fares based on your selection.</p>
                    <p>If you have a free weekend and don’t care about a destination, just select your origin and Skypicker will<br>
                    show you all possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Skypicker found that my reference routing is the cheapest with one stopover in Stockholm (the same as Momondo<br>
                    did) for a fare of $347. It is an unbeatable offer. The fact that Skypicker doesn’t redirect you to a fare<br>
                    provider and finalize the booking on its own makes from Skypicker a winner of our flight fare<br>
                    competition (at least for me).</p>
                    <p>Direct flight was more expensive than with Momondo or TripAdvisor. However, I would personally take them<br>
                    into the account also in this case since their booking process seems smoother without the redirection to<br>
                    the seller’s site. On the other hand, if you travel on a budget and look for a direct flight, vote for<br>
                    Momondo.</p>
                    <p>Skypicker’s mobile app is simple but great for our purposes.</p>
                    <p>There was just one little bug on Skypicker’s overall score. Although Skypicker allows you to set fare alert,<br>
                    it didn’t work.<br>

                    <h5><strong>Pros:</strong> Extensive in-house inventory of low-cost flights. Works without redirects to the seller’s websites. Outstanding user experience. What you see is what you pay. Interactive map. Responsive and innovative website and simple mobile app.</h5>
                    <h5><strong>Cons:</strong> Fare alert didn’t work.</h5>

                    <p>When you need to find anything on the internet, google it. It can be easily told also in case of a<br>
                    flight search because Google has its own search engine dedicated to flight fares. It searches across<br>
                    travel agents and airlines, including limited number of low-cost carriers.</p>
                    <p>Google Flight redirects you to a seller’s website to complete the booking.</p>
                    <p>In the case of my reference flight, the fare eventually increased from promising $397 to $444. It was the<br>
                    same situation as with Skyscanner, which makes me believe that Skyscanner runs on Google Flight engine.<br>
                    Nevertheless, it looks that both of them should update their inventories more frequently.</p>
                    <p>There is also a graph icon under the search details showing you estimated prices for different dates<br>
                    (like with Momondo). This feature can come in handy when your travel dates are flexible.<br>

                    <p>Is there anybody who doesn’t know Airbnb? It allows you to rent unique accommodations in people’s homes.</p>
                    <p>If you look for hotels, Airbnb isn’t a right place for you. Its listings vary from houses and apartments<br>
                    to tree houses, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/244853" target="_blank">igloos</a>, and castles.</p>
                    <p>Properties always clearly explain what you’ll find in the space, show you reviews of recent guests, and<br>
                    allow you to contact hosts and ask them a question.</p>
                    <p>Airbnb accommodation is usually cheaper than the cost of a hotel room. As a bonus, you can get perfect<br>
                    recommendations about a destination from the local host.</p>
                    <p>You don’t have to worry about paying in advance to some local stranger. Once you pay for a booking,<br>
                    Airbnb holds the payment for 24 hours after your check-in before releasing the funds to the host. You<br>
                    can pay with credit cards, PayPal, and Google Wallet (Android app and U.S. only).</p>
                    <p>I believe that Airbnb is in most cases perfectly safe way to rent a place to stay. On the other hand, I<br>
                    also found an article named <a href="http://www.supercompressor.com/culture/airbnb-horror-stories-the-worst-airbnb-experiences-ever" target="_blank">11 nightmarish Airbnb horror stories</a>,<br>
                    thus you should always be careful and listen to your inner voice.<br>

                    <p>Tingo is my another must-visit website. It is a side-product of TripAdvisor and promises the best price<br>
                    on the market by comparing major booking sites.</p>
                    <p>It is an ambitious claim, so I decided to put it to a test. Actually it failed. Tingo showed me a<br>
                    rate of $233 per night for a superior twin room, whilst Trivago found $225 with an additional offer of<br>
                    a superior double room for $211.</p>
                    <p>Although Tingo also claims that it would always match a lower price you found somewhere else, I wouldn’t<br>
                    probably bother with it and book elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>However, don’t cast Tingo aside prematurely. It monitors your rate and if it drops, Tingo will refund<br>
                    you the difference automatically. Moreover, if a rate of a better room drops and is lower than what you<br>
                    paid for, they’ll let you know so you can switch and enjoy the free upgrade. Welcome back to the game Tingo.</p>
                    <p>Tingo doesn’t have a dedicated mobile app, but its mobile version of the website works well on small devices.<br>

                    <h4>Price: Free</h4>
                    <p>Have you ever heard a term “couchsurfing”? It’s another product of current sharing economy. In fact, it<br>
                    is a global community of 10 million people in more than 200,000 cities.</p>
                    <p>Couchsurfers share their lives with people they encounter so you can basically stay with locals in every<br>
                    country on earth.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to Couchsurfing you can travel like a local, stay in someone’s home and experience the world from<br>
                    a different perspective.</p>
                    <p>As a bonus, it’s free. Why? Some people simply want to make new friends. If you like it, you can give<br>
                    back by opening your home to foreign travelers.</p>
                    <p>You think about a safety, right? Couchsurfing covers your back by encouraging you to communicate through<br>
                    their website, review hosts’ profile carefully, or check feedback of recent travelers.</p>
                    <p>Couchsurfers can also become verified, but I didn’t find further details about the verification process.<br>
                    It looks that you just pay $20 / year which makes you verified – I’m not sure whether paying $20 would<br>
                    discourage anybody from bad acts. You can also contact their safety team in case of emergency.<br>

                    free accommodation, you must take care about their lovely pets – feed them, walk them a few times a day<br>
                    – and keep their home well maintained and tidy.</p>
                    <p>In a meantime, you can explore the city. Trusted Housesitters is a marketplace where you pick a destination<br>

                    <p>To be perfectly true, you must first register with Trusted Housesitters. They offer only annual membership<br>

                    felt stressed and faced a fear of the unknown. No matter how often you fly, this apps won’t let you fear<br>

                    <p>There are few guarantees in air travel these days. Delays, cancellations, and mishandled baggages are never<br>
                    within your control. But having a place to check for possible flight compensations definitely is.</p>
                    <p>Did you know you can get $650 for a flight delay or cancellation, and $1,300 for denied boarding due to overbooking of<br>
                    the flight? And did you know that slight delay of your baggage is valued up to $3,400 of financial compensation?<br>
                    Yeah, it sounds good, I know.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the rules are damn complicated and tricky airlines make the issue even harder.<br>
                    ClaimAir is here to simplify the whole situation. You just enter flight details, answer several easy questions and<br>
                    let the app tell you what you can get.</p>
                    <p>The possibility of financial compensation is great, but sometimes the right to care,<br>
                    reimbursement, and free re-routing can come in handy too. In every case, the app gives you thorough instructions<br>
                    how to get what you deserve.</p>
                    <p>We created ClaimAir to help travelers on the go, right at the airport at the time of inconvenience. Nevertheless,<br>
                    the legislation allows you to claim your compensation up to six years back.</p>
                    <p>We give you the power and knowledge to solve the situation on your own. However, we are always here to help you out<br>
                    by acting on your behalf for 25% success-based fee. It’s risk-free, you won’t pay us anything until we get<br>
                    your compensation from the airline.<br>

                    <p>Airport lounges aren’t just for long layovers and VIP passengers thanks to LoungeBuddy.</p>
                    <p>LoungeBuddy works best once you completely fill out your profile. Just tell the app which elite<br>
                    statuses and lounge memberships you currently hold or which kind of credit cards you have. Based<br>
                    on this information, the app tells you which lounges are accessible at your airport either for<br>
                    free or for an access fee.</p>
                    <p>I have Citi Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard so I wanted to check lounges at London<br>
                    Heathrow airport. LoungeBuddy offered me 2 lounges with a free access and 7 paid lounges with a<br>
                    price ranging from $8 to $90. Yes, I won’t ever wait for my next flight at a boarding gate.</p>
                    <p>Prices without any memberships or credit cards are unaffordable, but it’s definitely worth a try in every<br>
                    case.</p>
                    <p>Right now, you can buy an access to lounges directly from the iOS app. Android users have to pay for the<br>
                    access somewhere at the airport.<br>

                    <p>Members get free parking, a car wash and get paid if their car is rented. The amount paid depends on a type of<br>
                    your car and year of manufacture. Of course, rental rates vary depending on car type too. The cheapest one I<br>

                    <p>It can be considered as a brand new type of dining experience. Forget eating in restaurants because<br>

                    <p>Trakdot is the only one physical product on the list. It can come in handy if you often travel with a<br>
                    hold baggage (the one that you hand in at a check-in desk).</p>
                    <p>It is a small device that allows you to keep track of your baggage while traveling.</p>
                    <p>Once you put your Trakdot device to the baggage and install Trakdot’s mobile app, you can see an exact<br>
                    location of your baggage real-time. If you don’t instal the mobile app, Trackdot will notify you through<br>
                    a text message.</p>
                    <p>With Trakdot you are literally the first one who knows whether your baggage arrived to the expected<br>
                    destination or whether your baggage was mishandled.</p>
                    <p>The device costs $69.98 which includes the first year subscription. Consequently, you must pay an annual<br>
                    subscription fee amounting to $19.99. Definitely worth the money.<br>

                    <p>Google recently implemented two major features into Google Translate.</p>
                    <p>The first is about automatic language detection in conversation mode, so having a conversation between<br>
                    two people who don’t speak the same language is possible.</p>
                    <p>Although it can be useful for some simple and well-pronounced sentences, this feature is still in its<br>
                    early stage. In other words, don’t expect Star Trek’s universal translator.</p>
                    <p>The second feature is much more interesting as it works great. It is about<br>
                    <a href="http://fat.gfycat.com/LikableHandsomeIndianpangolin.webm" target="_blank">translation of written text.</a><br>
                    You just hold your phone up so the text is visible onscreen, and the app will automatically translate<br>
                    the words.<br>
